### Introduction
Sequential pattern mining identifies patterns and trends in sequential data, commonly used in market basket analysis, bioinformatics, and user behavior analysis.

### Key Techniques
#### **1. Apriori-based Sequential Pattern Mining**
- Extends Apriori to handle sequential transactions.

#### **2. PrefixSpan (Prefix-projected Sequential Pattern Mining)**
- Efficiently finds sequential patterns without candidate generation.

### Real-World Applications
- **E-commerce**: Predicting next product purchases.
- **Healthcare**: Identifying common treatment sequences.
- **Web Usage Mining**: Analyzing browsing behavior.

### Advantages
✅ Helps uncover trends in time-series data.  
✅ Improves recommendation systems.  

### Limitations
