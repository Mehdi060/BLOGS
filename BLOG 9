## Blog 9: Graph-Based Data Mining

### Introduction
Graph-based data mining focuses on analyzing relationships between entities, widely used in social networks, fraud detection, and bioinformatics.

### Techniques in Graph-Based Data Mining
#### **1. Graph Traversal Algorithms**
- BFS, DFS for exploring connections in networks.

#### **2. Community Detection Algorithms**
- Identifies clusters in social networks.

#### **3. PageRank Algorithm**
- Used in search engines to rank web pages.

### Real-World Applications
- **Social Network Analysis**: Identifying influencers on platforms like Twitter.
- **Fraud Detection**: Detecting fraudulent transactions in banking.
- **Drug Discovery**: Analyzing molecular interactions.

### Advantages
✅ Captures complex relationships between data points.  
✅ Effective for large-scale network analysis.  

### Limitations
❌ Computationally expensive for large graphs.  

### Conclusion
Graph-based data mining is essential for understanding interconnected data structures and relationships.
