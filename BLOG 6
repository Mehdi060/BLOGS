## Blog 6: Anomaly Detection in Data Mining

### Introduction
Anomaly detection identifies unusual patterns in data that do not conform to expected behavior. It is widely used in fraud detection, cybersecurity, and industrial monitoring.

### Techniques for Anomaly Detection
#### **1. Statistical Methods**
- Identify anomalies based on deviations from mean, median, or standard deviation.

#### **2. Machine Learning Approaches**
- **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled datasets (e.g., fraud vs. non-fraud).
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Identifies anomalies without predefined labels (e.g., clustering techniques like DBSCAN).

#### **3. Deep Learning Techniques**
- Autoencoders and LSTMs are used for detecting complex patterns in time-series data.

### Real-World Applications
- **Fraud Detection**: Identifying fraudulent credit card transactions.
- **Cybersecurity**: Detecting network intrusions and malware.
- **Healthcare**: Identifying rare diseases in medical diagnostics.

### Advantages
✅ Effective for identifying rare and unusual patterns.  
✅ Works with both structured and unstructured data.  

### Limitations
❌ False positives can be high.  
❌ Requires continuous monitoring and retraining.  

### Conclusion
Anomaly detection is crucial for security and monitoring applications, helping organizations identify and mitigate risks.
