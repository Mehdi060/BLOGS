## Blog 3: Clustering Techniques (K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering)

### Introduction
Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups similar data points together. It is widely used in customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and pattern recognition.

### Types of Clustering Algorithms
#### **1. K-Means Clustering**
- Partitions data into **K clusters** based on similarity.
- Uses **centroids** to represent each cluster.
- Requires specifying the number of clusters (K) beforehand.

#### **2. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**
- Groups points based on **density** rather than specifying K.
- Can identify **outliers** (noise) that don’t fit any cluster.
- Works well for irregularly shaped clusters.

#### **3. Hierarchical Clustering**
- Creates a **tree-like structure (dendrogram)** of nested clusters.
- Can be **agglomerative (bottom-up)** or **divisive (top-down)**.
- No need to specify K, but computationally expensive for large datasets.

### Real-World Applications
- **Customer Segmentation**: Grouping customers based on purchase behavior.
- **Image Segmentation**: Identifying objects in images.
- **Fraud Detection**: Detecting unusual transactions in banking.
- **Social Network Analysis**: Understanding relationships between users.

### Advantages
✅ K-Means is fast and scalable for large datasets.  
✅ DBSCAN is great for detecting outliers.  
✅ Hierarchical clustering provides a detailed view of relationships.  

### Limitations
❌ K-Means requires specifying K in advance.  
❌ DBSCAN struggles with varying densities in clusters.  
❌ Hierarchical clustering is not scalable for very large datasets.  

### Conclusion
Clustering techniques allow businesses and researchers to extract meaningful insights from raw data by identifying natural groupings within datasets.
