## Blog 4: Classification Algorithms (Decision Trees, Naïve Bayes, SVM)

### Introduction
Classification is a supervised learning technique used to categorize data into predefined labels. It is widely used in spam detection, sentiment analysis, and medical diagnosis.

### Key Classification Algorithms
#### **1. Decision Trees**
- Uses a **tree-like model** to split data based on features.
- Easy to understand and interpret.
- Prone to overfitting if not pruned properly.

#### **2. Naïve Bayes**
- Based on **Bayes’ theorem**, assuming feature independence.
- Works well with **small datasets** and text classification.
- Used in spam filtering and sentiment analysis.

#### **3. Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- Finds an **optimal hyperplane** to separate classes.
- Effective for **high-dimensional** data.
- Can be computationally expensive.

### Real-World Applications
- **Email Filtering**: Classifying emails as spam or non-spam.
- **Healthcare**: Predicting diseases based on patient symptoms.
- **Finance**: Credit risk assessment for loan approvals.
- **Social Media**: Detecting hate speech and fake news.

### Advantages
✅ Decision Trees are easy to visualize and interpret.  
✅ Naïve Bayes is efficient for text classification tasks.  
✅ SVM works well for complex datasets with high dimensionality.  

### Limitations
❌ Decision Trees can overfit if not controlled.  
❌ Naïve Bayes assumes feature independence, which may not hold true.  
❌ SVM can be computationally expensive for large datasets.  

### Conclusion
Classification algorithms are essential for making predictions and have broad applications in various industries, from finance to healthcare.
