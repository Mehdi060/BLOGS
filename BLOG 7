## Blog 7: Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, LDA, t-SNE)

### Introduction
Feature selection and dimensionality reduction are techniques used to improve model performance by reducing irrelevant or redundant features in datasets.

### Techniques for Feature Selection & Dimensionality Reduction
#### **1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- Converts high-dimensional data into lower dimensions while preserving variance.
- Commonly used in image processing and genomics.

#### **2. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**
- Focuses on maximizing class separability in classification tasks.

#### **3. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**
- Used for visualizing high-dimensional data in two or three dimensions.

### Real-World Applications
- **Image Compression**: PCA is used to reduce image size while preserving essential features.
- **Speech Recognition**: LDA enhances feature selection for voice-based systems.
- **Data Visualization**: t-SNE helps in clustering large datasets.

### Advantages
✅ Improves computational efficiency.  
✅ Reduces model overfitting by removing irrelevant features.  

### Limitations
❌ Some information loss can occur during transformation.  
❌ t-SNE is computationally expensive.  

### Conclusion
Feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques are essential for optimizing machine learning models and improving data visualization.
